Play-Example-QA
---------------

This project (when completed) will show how to integrate quality assurance tools like Checkstyle and PMD into Play applications.

It is based upon: https://github.com/ymasory/sbt-code-quality.g8

Currently it does not work, because I do not know how to integrate the CheckStyle and Pmd settings into the Play project definition in Build.sdt.
